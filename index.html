              <h3>Multi Instrumentalist</h3>
              <p>With my ability to play sevenish instruments (guitar, drums, cello, accordion, keys, beatbox), I can pick up new skills quickly, and memorizing songs helps me memorize weird things like my bank routing number.</p>

              <h3>Divergent Thinker</h3>
              <p>I am able to come up with non-traditional out of the box solutions to problems, like plugging a bath drain with a mason jar lid and a rock.  Last time I wrapped rubber bands around the top of a kombucha bottle.  The mason jar lid/rock combo is slightly more effective.  This kind of thinking is crucial for coding and cannot be taught.</p>

              <h3>I work hard</h3>
              <p>Whether I'm dashing from table to table for minimum wage or I'm making 'grown up money', I will work hard and get results.  I literally used to write "No want work? Call Grisha!" on the schedule of The Little Grill, which to this day has the best breakfast in Harrisonburg, VA.  I also used to teach groups of four year olds to ski.  It's not easy.  Now I run high budget ad spends in Google Ads, it's a little easier.</p>

              <h3>What? More awards?</h3>
              <p>I have hired and trained a successful sales team, washed dishes as fast as possible, and on many occassions I have received awards for my work. In one case it was commended by Bill Taylor, former US Ambassador to Ukraine and Guy In The News.  I didn't do anything to earn that award, everyone got one, but the "Most Shifts Covered" is 100% mine.</p>
